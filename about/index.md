Iâ€™m a Dutch generic twentysomething computerscience student that likes read, write and compete on the football field (go Giants!).


I will be sharing my experiences as a student of software development and hopefully help people struggling with the same problems as I do (probably not a lot of people, since I am always struggling). If not then hopefully you will be entertained by my mishaps and reports on countless wasted hours because of my tunnelvision and stubbornness.
 
Not always so sincerely, 
Lasse  


_PS: In case you are wondering, the header image is from my favorite movie: [The Assasination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443680/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). If you haven't seen it yet, check it out! It has some gorgeous cinematography!_
