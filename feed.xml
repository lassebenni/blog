  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I am still a college student, majoring in Computer Science, ever so often I will be discussing my endevours at the Hanze Hogeschool in Groningen (where I live,love,life… and scene!). I like to put my thoughts on paper (Oh, really, then why do I hardly ever do that? This is a start, shut up, me.) and this blog will probably just be a journal of kinds for me as a developer. What kind of developer that will be is still in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September I will be enrolling in a Web Development Minor, which will hopefully provide me the opportunity to catch up on some much needed web dev knowledge. For the past years I have been messing around with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript but not enough in my taste.  At the University (Hogeschool in Dutch, there is a distinction), we have been leaning on Software Engineering for the past 3 years, mainly focusing on Java application building with occasional bouts of php.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be brutally honest, I don’t think I know enough of either Software Engineering or Web Development to be working in the industry yet. I will be honing my skills the coming years. What I do have is a yearning (what a word) for knowledge and I do love to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well this was basically my first blogpost (not considering the welcome post) and it is far too soon to ask the crowd for opinions, so I will leave it like this for today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
